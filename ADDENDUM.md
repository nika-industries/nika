Addendum to the AGPL: Restriction on Commercial Use in Direct Competition

**Direct Competition Restriction**: You may not use the Software, nor any modified version of the Software, to provide a service that competes directly with Nika Industries. For the purposes of this addendum, a service "competes directly" if it provides substantially similar functionality and is targeted at substantially the same market as Nika Industries.

**Commercial Use Definition**: "Commercial use" shall mean any use of the Software or modified versions of the Software in exchange for payment or other consideration.

**Separate Commercial License**: If you wish to use the Software in a manner that may be construed as competing directly with Nika Industries, you must obtain a separate commercial license from Nika Industries.

By using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of the AGPL and this addendum.
